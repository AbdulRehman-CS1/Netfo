# Netfo
Netfo is a lightweight, user-friendly tool that monitors all outgoing connections on your system in real-time. It displays active connections by process, including IP, port, and hostname, with no need to specify a PID. Designed for simplicity, Netfo requires no prior Linux experienceâ€”just install Python and run.
